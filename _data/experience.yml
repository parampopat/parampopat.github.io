   Stock Market Prediction through Statistical Indicators and Machine Learning.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Analysed a wide variety of external factors that affect the Indian Stock Market and Engineered Neural Network systems to incorporate the delayed correlation effects between stocks and factors strongly affecting their movement. 
    
    Developed an Ensemble of Statistical Cross-Correlation, Causal relationships and time-series machine learning models like LSTM to predict a mix of profiteering stocks with their movement 1 week ahead and auto-invest in them. This system gave up to 48% returns over an investment period of 12 months.
    
    Evaluated the seasonality in stocks where some escalate in specific periods like holidays and devised a GRU based Neural Network model to investigate prominent seasonality in all the National Stock Exchange, IN listed companies and output an ideal time to invest and divest for optimum profits. Structured an ensemble of seasonality and the effect of external factors on stock, this accelerated the year-over-year returns to 65%.

   AI-Enabled Photography Services.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Designed an AI-based Snap pipeline to auto-edit photographs, resize, compress, and package them for expedited delivery times. This pipeline achieved a reduction of 60% in the time taken from the event to the final delivery as compared to the manual process, thus delivering photos in 4 days instead of standard 10 business days.
    
    Developed an API based web-app to electronically deliver rendered photos to clients with a secure OTP mechanism and to manage collision-free Event bookings. This system would also fetch and upload finished photos from the Snap pipeline, and allow photographers to keep a track of photos requiring personal attention.
    
    Managed a team of 5 photographers and freelancers catering 300+ clients, covering open-mics, poetry events, conferences, etc.
